## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

### Site URL

- [Live Site URL](https://chat-app-css-illustration-alpha.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5, CSS3
- Dart Sass
  - variables, mixins, placeholders
  - `@use`, `@forward` keywords instead of `@import`
  - `@for`, `@if` keywords (awesome stuff!)
- CSS `@keyframes` rule
- Tailwind (CSS framework)
- Some patience ðŸ˜…

### What I learned

At first, I intended to learn another CSS framework, but in the end, I realized that I actually don't like them. (I did use Tailwind classes, though.) My true love is SASS, and I learned some new things about it once again, namely how to properly use `@for` and `@if`. 

### Continued development

- It's about time I deepened my JS knowledge, I guess. ðŸ™‚
